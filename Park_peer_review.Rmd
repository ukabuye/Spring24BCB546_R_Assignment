Peer review of R assignment

1. I tried knit Usamah's code
  - Unfortunately, I got an error with line 52 - 55 saying "cannot open the connection"
  - So, to complete the peer review, I deleted line 52 - 55, then the code worked!

2. Data inspection
  - I ran his code for the data inspection. It looked good to me. He went through the type, size, dimensions, structures of each file

3. Data wrangling
  - I like his workflow of code. The code seems worked very well.
  - He did very well to create two files of maize and teosinte respectively with generating chromosome 1 to 10 automatically.

4. Data visualization
  - He successfully made graphs to see distrubition and diversity of SNPs per chromosome
  - The figures look great!
  - Lastly, his own visulization which is the density variation of SNPs associated with homozygous A was good.

5. Summary
  - In my opinion, his code worked well. And the overall structure is good. I think he understand his job for the assignment and code in R.
    Great job!
